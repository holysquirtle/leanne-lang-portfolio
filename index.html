      <h1 id="hello" class="intro">Hi, I'm Leanne, a Web Developer in California. I'm passionate about solving problems with information and a magic bag of tools. 
        I'm in love with the space where function, form, and faculty meet.

      <p>I have a zeal for learning, and the path from Library Reference to Software Engineering was a clear one.
        Accumulating different resources, skills, and techniques has always been something of a hobby with no
        apparent progression or culmination -- with the exception of increasing adeptness at search-term-tinkering.
        I'm looking forward to further refining my tools and shifting gears from generalist to specialist in the
        professional sphere and working with others heading in a similar direction. In the realm of
        "information-hobbyist" however, I'll be holding onto my active past-times as a quasi-seamstress and amateur
        herbalist.

    <h2>Tools from Library School</h2>
    <hr>
      <p>While data science and information science exist on different ends of the spectrum, there are several key overlapping areas of mastery:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Problem solving & Problem definition - The soul of the Reference Interview is the path to any solution.</li>
          <li>Information utility - How information is likely to be used informs good semantic structuring. </li>
          <li>Search strategies & Electronic Resource Management - When "Stack Exchange or Google it" isn't as efficient as it could be. Discovering a new functional information resource is my shiny thing.</li>
        </ul>
